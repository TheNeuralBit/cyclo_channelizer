(ABSTRACT)

\end{center}

One common problem in Software-Defined Radio (SDR) systems is the problem of detecting and then isolating narrow signals of interest in wideband sampled data. This involves using some means to detect the frequency of one or more signals of interest and then tuning, filtering, and decimating them. This problem is particularly challenging due to the high sample rate of this wideband data, so efficient algorithms are very desirable. Solutions to this problem have applications in many areas, including both Cognitive Radio and Electronic Warfare.

A MATLAB simulation of an SDR framework for detecting and sub-band tuning channelized signals is presented, with a focus on finding an efficient means to combine the two algorithms. Detection is performed using the spectral-correlation density function which exploits the cyclostationary property of digital signals \cite{Gardner1}.  These detections are then used to direct a channelizer which will tune, filter, and decimate all of the detected signals. Two different channelizer structures are examined â€“ a polyphase analysis/synthesis channelizer \cite{Harris1} and an overlap-save filter bank \cite{Borgerding1}.

A summary of relevant background information is provided.  This includes a discussion of cyclostationarity and the spectral-correlation density function as well as background on both channelizer structures. For the overlap-save filter bank it will be shown that in many cases computation can be saved by using the same FFT computation for both the cyclostationary detector and the channelizer.

In this simulation, simple QPSK signals are used to model the signals of interest, but the framework is applicable to any modulation or signal type that has cyclostationary features. While other means of signal detection may be more reliable for specific signals, a cyclostationary detector's primary strength is its ability to function for many different types of digital signals.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\markright{Brian H. Hulette \hfill Chapter \ref{sec:intro}. Introduction \hfill}

A common problem when designing a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) system is the
problem of detecting and tuning signals of interest. A typical SDR will sample
at a relatively high rate to acquire a wideband signal. Then it will attempt to
detect the channels within the acquired frequency range that contain signals of
interest, and then tune, filter, decimate, and demodulate those signals. 

%TODO: links to SDR frameworks (webSDR)
%TODO: image of SDR plotting
Many popular SDR applications perform this detection step with a
"man-in-the-loop".  A falling raster of the wideband data is presented and the
man-in-the-loop will "click-tune" to select  the frequencies that (s)he would
like to process. One common version of this is to acquire a wideband slice of
the HAM radio spectrum and then click tune to different frequencies to
demodulate new FM Push-to-Talk signals and listen to them.

In this paper I will investigate and simulate a structure that automates this
process - but rather than working for a single analog signal, this framework is
intended for an arbitrary number of digital signals. Detection is performed by
a cyclostationary detector rather than by a man-in-the-loop, in order to exploit
the cyclostationary properties exhibited by most digital signals with a fixed
symbol rate.  Tuning, filtering, and decimating is performed by a channelizer, so
that many signals can be processed at once.  I will examine two different
channelizer structures. They will be compared on two important criteria:
1) Their ability to accurately reproduce every detected signal, and 2) Their
computational efficiency when combined with a cyclostationary detector.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:cyclo} I will provide background information on
cyclostationary properties and the cyclic spectra upon which my detector relies.
Chapter~\ref{sec:chan} discusses and compares both of the channelizer structures
that I will simulate. Chapter~\ref{sec:sim}  discusses the MATLAB simulation I 
have created and the results of it. Finally, Chapter~\ref{sec:source} provides
annotated source code for key parts of the simulation, as well as locations
where the entire source code can be found.

\section{Cyclostationarity}
\label{sec:cyclo_prop}
Often signals are modeled as stochastic random processes with properties such as
mean and variance, but many man-made signals, particularly digital communications,
can be modeled with another statistical property called
\emph{cyclostationarity} which implies the signal has some parameter which
varies with time. The frequency of this variation is called the cyclic
frequency, $\alpha$. \cite{Gardner1}.

% Gardner1 = Exploitation of Spectral Redundancy in Cyclostationary Signals
% Oner1 = Cyclostationarity Based Air Interface Recognition for Software Radio Systems
% Gardner2 = Spectral Correlation of Modulated Signals: Part II - Digital Modulation
% Harris1 = Digital Receivers and Transmitters Using Polyphase
Filter Banks for Wireless Communications
% Borgerding1 = Turning Overlap-Save into a Multiband Mixing, Downsampling Filter Bank

Of particular interest is second-order cyclostationarity, where a signal has a
periodic autocorrelation:

\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{lCl}
    R_{xx}(t, t+\tau) = E\{x(t)x^*(t+\tau)\} = \sum_{\alpha} R_{xx}^{\alpha}(\tau)e^{j2 \pi \alpha t}
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}

% TODO more detail here based on Oner1

\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{lCl}
    R_{xx}^{\alpha}(\tau) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} R_{xx}(t, t+\tau)e^{-j2\pi \alpha t} dt
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
% TODO: reference papers that perform time domain detection (listed in "Energy Efficient Spectrum Sensing using Cyclostationarity")
% "Cyclostationary Based Air Interface Recognition For Software Radio Systems" is also a time domain approach
The cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF), given by $R_{xx}^{\alpha}(\tau)$, can
be used for signal detection in the time domain. An estimate of the 2D function
versus $\alpha$ and $\tau$ can be computed, then features within this plane can be
detected. However, what I am interested in is the fourier transform of the CAF,
called the Spectral Correlation Density (SCD):

\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{lCl}
    S_{xx}(\alpha, f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_{xx}^{\alpha}(\tau)e^{-j2\pi f \tau} d\tau
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}

The SCD is a generalization of the conventional PSD, which it reduces to at $\alpha=0$
\cite{Oner1}. Like the CAF, the SCD also contains unique features based on the modulation
type, symbol rate, and carrier frequency of the transmitted signal, which we can
exploit for signal detection. In \cite{Gardner2}, Gardner defines this SCD for
various basic modulation types, including QPSK, which is used in my simulation.

%\section{Exploiting Cyclostationarity for Detection}
%\label{sec:exploit_cyc}
%For the problem defined in Chapter \ref{sec:intro} we can define the wideband
%signal $W(t)$ as the sum of $N$ cyclostationary signals, tuned to
%various frequencies, in an AWGN channel:
%\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{lCl}
%    W(t) & = & \sum C_{i}(t) e^{j 2 \pi f_i t} + N(t)
%\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
%
%Where the $C_i(t)$ are cyclostationary random processes at various symbol rates,
%tuned to corresponding frequencies $f_i$ and $N(t)$ is the AWGN.
%
%We would like to exploit the cyclostationarity of the $C_i$ waveforms to
%identify the frequency, $f_i$, of those waveforms which are transmitted at a
%specific symbol rate.

\section{Estimating the SCD}
% Use Gardner1 to show that SCD is conjugate multiplication of frequency shifted spectra

% Discuss possibility of circular shifting a forward FFT to estimate SCD slice
