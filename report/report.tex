(ABSTRACT)

\vfill

\end{center}

A MATLAB simulation of an SDR framework for detecting and subband tuning
channelized signals is presented.  Detection is performed using cyclic spectra
at various baud rates of interest.  These detections are then used to direct a
channelizer which will tune, filter, and decimate all of the detected signals.
Two different channelizer structures are examined - a polyphase
analysis/synthesis channelizer [harris] and an overlap-save filter bank
[Borgerding]. This framework has applications in both Cognitive Radio and
Electronic Warfare.

A summary of relevant background information is provided.  This includes a
discussion of cyclostationarity and the cyclic spectrum as well as background
on both channelizer structures. For the overlap-save filter bank it will be 
shown that in many cases computation can be saved by re-using the FFT computed
for the cyclostationary detector.

In this simulation simple QPSK signals are used to model the signals of 
interest, but the framework is applicable to any modulation or signal type
that has cyclostationary features - which is true of most digital signals. 
While other means of signal detection may be more reliable for specific signals,
a cyclostationary detector's primary strength is its ability to function for many
different digital signals.

I would like to acknowledge the work of both Craig Carlson and Ruth Stoehr. Much of the source for this project for both generating and processing a simple 
QPSK signal came from the ECE5654 project which we completed in the Spring 
of 2013.

I would like to thank my current employer, n~ask, inc., and all of my co-workers
there for their support.

I would also like to thank the members of my committee, particularly Dr.
Zaghloul, for their seemingly endless patience and support.

Finally I would like to thank my friends and family, particularly my girlfriend Meredith, for letting me use ``My Master's" as an excuse for nearly anything.

A common problem when designing a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) system is the problem of detecting and tuning signals of interest. A typical SDR will sample at a relatively high rate to acquire a wideband signal. Then it will attempt to detect the channels that contain frequencies of interest, and then tune, filter, decimate, and demodulate those signals. 

%TODO: links to SDR frameworks (webSDR)
%TODO: image of SDR plotting
Many popular SDR applications perform this detection step with a "man-in-the-loop".  A falling raster of the wideband data is presented and the man-in-the-loop will "click-tune" to select  the frequencies that (s)he would like to process. One common version of this is to acquire a wideband slice of the HAM radio spectrum and then click tune to different frequencies to demodulate new FM Push-to-Talk signals and listen to them.

In this paper I will investigate and simulate a structure that automates this process - but rather than working for a single analog signal, this framework is intended for an arbitrary number of digital signals. Detection is performed by a cyclostationary detector rather than by a man-in-the-loop, in order to exploit the cyclostationary properties exhibited by most digital signals with a fixed baud rate.  Tuning, filtering, and decimating is performed by a channelizer, so that many signals can be processed at once.  I will examine two different channelizer structures. They will be compared on two important criteria: 1) Their ability to accurately reproduce every detected signal, and 2) Their computational efficiency when combined with a cyclostationary detector.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:cyclo} I will provide background information on cyclostationary properties and the cyclic spectra upon which my detector relies.  Chapter~\ref{sec:chan} discusses and compares both of the channelizer structures that I will simulate. Chapter~\ref{sec:sim}  discusses the MATLAB simulation I have created and the results of it. Finally, Chapter~\ref{sec:source} provides annotated source code for key parts of the simulation, as well as locations where the entire source code can be found.
