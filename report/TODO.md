Rough Draft Goals
-----------------
- [X] Abstract
- [X] Introduction
- [X] Cyclostationarity and SCD discussion
- [X] Overlap-Save Channelizer Discussion
- [X] fred harris Channelizer Discussion
- [X] Simulation
    - [X] Discussion of testbench (QPSK transmit/receive, gen_test_sig)
    - [X] SCD estimate plots
    - [X] Discussion of cyclo detect procedure (SCD estimates, peak detect)
    - [X] Discussion of overall architecture (cyclo + OS)
    - [X] Discussion of overall architecture (cyclo + fred harris)
- [X] Code details

Required tasks
--------------
- [X] Polyphase synthesis final structure figure

Other thoughts
--------------
- [ ] Clarify use of the word channelizer? Overlap-save channelizer works for
      arbitrary frequencies
- [ ] Analysis of choosing FFT size, sample rate, decimation factor etc...
- [ ] Make images more legible (Dr. Z said theyre too small)
